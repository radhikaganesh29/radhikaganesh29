Hi, I’m Radhika. I’m a Computer Science graduate from Indiana University Bloomington with a passion for solving real world problems through a mix of thoughtful engineering and data driven insight. I enjoy building things that scale, whether it’s backend systems, data pipelines, or interactive dashboards. I’ve worked in fintech, nonprofits, and early stage startups, where I’ve explored everything from writing clean code to uncovering insights through analytics and machine learning. My work brings together software development and data to create solutions that are both technically sound and meaningful. I’m always curious, always learning, and driven by the impact technology can create when built with care and purpose.
